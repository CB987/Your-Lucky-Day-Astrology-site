<h1>Your Lucky Website </h1>
<h3>First DigitalCrafts' Group Project </h3>
<h3> by Clare Barton, April Copes, Helen Harris, Helen Hasegawa  </h3>

For our group project we built an astrological website.<br> The functionality of the site is to have a daily changing astronomy image background, provide astrological data and a randomly retrieved piece of advice.<br> Our main focus was to implement all the things we've learned so far in the class. These include but are not limited to:
 - git and gitHub
 - using event listeners in the modal
 - responsive CSS
 - front-end functionality
 - DOM manipulation
 - Promise/ Promise
 - teamwork
 - confidence in writing code from scratch
  
<h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
  <ol><li>The API call that creates the background image is to Nasa's Astrological Picture of the Day. However, sometimes the 'image' of the day is a video!</li>
  <li>2.When </li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>How the Challenges were Solved:</h2>
  <ol>We did some experimentation with making the video run as the background. We got pretty far with it, but ultimately didn't have enough time to make sure it was bug-free, so instead our solution was to have the image be a default image instead of a video if the API call came back as a video.
